<h1 align="center">📊 EDA Portfolio using Python & Pandas</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>A clean and insightful analysis of multiple datasets for better decision-making.</b><br/>
  This project is part of my personal journey into Data science and Machine Learning
</p>

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects** performed on different datasets. Each notebook demonstrates how to explore, visualize, and extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python and `pandas`.  

Key tasks performed include:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature extraction
- Visualizations and trend analysis
- Insights and recommendations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eda-portfolio.git
cd eda-portfolio
```
### 2. Insatll Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Place raw datasets inside
```bash
# Put all your original datasets (Excel, CSV) here
data/raw/
```
### 4. Processed or cleaned outputs are saved to
```bash
# Cleaned or processed datasets will be stored here
data/processed/
```
### 5. Open notebooks
```bash
# Launch Jupyter Notebook to view and run analysis
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```
### 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.x

- pandas, numpy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

### 🧠 Learnings

- Importance of data exploration before modeling

- Handling missing and inconsistent data

- Understanding trends, correlations, and distributions

- Presenting insights in a clear, reproducible format
  
### 📈 Future Improvements

- Add more datasets from different domains (Finance, Healthcare, Retail, etc.)

- Automate EDA report generation using Python scripts

- Explore interactive visualization with Plotly/Streamlit

- Modularize notebooks for reusable analysis pipelines
